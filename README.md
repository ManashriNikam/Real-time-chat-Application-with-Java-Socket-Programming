# Real-time-chat-Application-with-Java-Socket-Programming

The Real-Time Chat Application is designed to enable instant communication between multiple users over a network. The system follows a client-server architecture where the server manages client connections and message broadcasting, while each client can send and receive messages in real time.
Java Socket Programming is used to establish reliable communication channels, and multithreading is implemented on the server side to handle multiple client connections concurrently. This project demonstrates key networking concepts such as TCP/IP communication, socket handling, thread management, and input/output streams, making it a practical example of real-time distributed systems.
